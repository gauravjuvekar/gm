\section{Study all polygon related functions in \texttt{graphics.h} and explain any
  four.}
\texttt{libgraph} includes the following polygon related functions
\begin{description}
    \item [\texttt{rectangle}] {draws a rectangle outline with the current
        colour, given the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right point.}
    \item [\texttt{bar}] {draws a filled rectangle, similar to the
        \texttt{rectangle} function.}
    \item [\texttt{drawpoly}] {draws a polygon outline given a sequence of its
      vertices.  It takes a list of vertices and uses a line drawing algorithm
      internally to draw the edges in order.}
    \item [\texttt{fillpoly}] {draws a filled polygon, similar to the
        \texttt{drawpoly} function.}
\end{description}
